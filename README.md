## Domain Specific Information Retrieval System 

* The task is to build a search engine which will cater to the needs of a particular domain. 
* The IR model is fed with documents containing information of around 27K songs, including the track id and the respective posting list. 
* It will then process the data and build a set of vectors with values in each dimension(song words) being the TF-IDF values in that dimension.
* Once this is done, the user will give a query as an input.
* Top 10 relevant documents as returned as the output.
